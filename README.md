# Unsupervised Machine Learning and Cryptocurrencies

## Overview of Project
For this week's project, we will be using unsupervised machine learning to discover patterns or groups in our data. Unsupervised learning only uses input data and there is no known output. We will be using clustering and K-means algorithm to group our data together. We will also be using principal component analysis (PCA) to limit features and speed up the model.


### Purpose
The purpose of this week's project is to help Accountability Accounting, an investment bank, generate a report on cryptocurrencies. They are currently interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for their customers. Our analysis will inform Accountability Accounting what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market as well as group them to create a classification system for this new investment. We'll be using unsupervised learning since there is no known output. We'll also be creating data visualizations to display our findings.
