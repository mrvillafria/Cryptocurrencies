## Overview of Project
For this week's project, we will be using unsupervised machine learning to discover patterns or groups in our data. Unsupervised learning only uses input data and there is no known output. We will be using clustering and K-means algorithm to group our data together. We will also be using principal component analysis (PCA) to limit features and speed up the model.


### Purpose
